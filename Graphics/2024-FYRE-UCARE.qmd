# Quick Start

Important considerations:

-   What story are you trying to tell?

-   Who is your audience?

-   What background is important?

Mechanics:

-   What variables do you want to show?

-   What type of variables?

    -   Numerical

        -   Continuous

        -   Discrete-ish

    -   Categorical

        -   Ordered

        -   Unordered

    -   Text

-   Are you going to summarize the variables? How?

Plot Formation:

-   What type of geometry will best show your comparison(s) of interest?

-   Color choice:

    -   Are there natural color associations with your variables? (red for hot, blue for cold, etc.)

    -   Do you have a specific theme to use?

    -   Are your colors colorblind friendly, or can you dual-encode the information?

    -   Do you have enough contrast?

-   Element sizing:

    -   Fonts should be large enough to be accessible/readable (in context)
