This is *not* a recommended graphical form.)\n\nThese are some of my favorite examples, but of course, there are also bad charts in the scientific literature [@broman18].\nThe goal of this module is to ensure that as you work on research, you will create effective graphics that are accessible and well-designed.\n\n# Designing Good Charts\n\n## Why Graphics Matter\n\nGraphics are a form of **external cognition** that allow us to think about the *data* rather than the *chart*.\n\nThat is, graphics are a tool to make it easier for us to think about what the data means.\n\nGood graphics take advantage of how the brain works, leveraging\n\n-   preattentive processing\n\n-   perceptual grouping\n\n-   awareness of visual limitations\n\nGood graphics also depend on the data: the chart type should be chosen based on the types of variables you want to display, the amount of data you have, and the results you want to highlight.\n\n### Example: Hertzsprung Russell Diagram\n\nOur first example of a good chart is the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram [@wikipediacontributors23b].\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.dpi='300'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The Hertzsprung Russell diagram. Discovered independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873–1967) and Henry Norris Russell (1877–1957). The diagram plots the color index of the star against the brightness (absolute magnitude) of the star. As a result, it is possible to discern that these two variables are related and change together over a star's life cycle: a hypothesis that only came to be because of this chart.](2023-REU_files/figure-html/HR-diagram-1.png){fig-alt='A scatter plot showing the color index of a star on the x-axis and the absolute magnitude (brightness) of the star on the y-axis. Points are colored by spectral class, which varies from blue to white to yellow to red as the color index increases and the star\\'s temperature decreases. Points are primarily located along a downward-sloping line from the top left to the bottom right, which is labeled the \\'main sequence\\'. There is another set of points which diverges from the main sequence and extends out horizontally in the middle of the graph; these are labeled \\'giants\\', and a few outliers that are above the giant cluster are labeled \\'supergiants\\'. Below the main sequence stars, there are outliers which are labeled \\'dwarfs\\'.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJohn Tukey, a famous statistician often considered the father of statistical graphics, wrote in Exploratory Data Analysis (1977):\n\n> The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.\n\nThis chart is an excellent example of the value that good graphics create in research: they can help us understand our data in a new way, leading to innovations and new research directions.\n\nDiscuss:\n\n-   What variables are mapped to the following chart dimensions?\n\n    -   X location\n    -   Y location\n    -   color\n\n-   What other information is present on the chart that is not specifically a data value?\n\n-   What does this chart do well?\n\n-   What design features \"work\"?\n\n-   What don't you like?\n\nI've used data from the [HYG Database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) to generate this chart.\nOnly stars within 500 AU are shown.\n\n## Perceptual Principles\n\n### Preattentive Perception\n\n-   Occurs automatically (no effort)\n\n-   Color, shape, angle\n\n-   Combinations of preattentive features require attention\n\n    -   Double-encoding (using multiple features for the same variable) is ok\n\n\n::: {#fig-preattentive1 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Shape](2023-REU_files/figure-html/fig-preattentive1-1.png){#fig-preattentive1-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Color](2023-REU_files/figure-html/fig-preattentive1-2.png){#fig-preattentive1-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nTwo scatterplots with one point that is different.

G has a white stripe over it, demonstrating closure - the stripe and the G are perceived as separate objects. E is shown as a grid of black squares, with grey squares making up the background; this demonstrates proximity - small objects close together are perceived as being part of the same whole. A bar is woven through the S shape, showing good continuation - the S is perceived as a continuous object that is behind the bar in the middle portion. The two Ts are striped and indicate similarity - they are similarly shaped and patterned and can be perceived as a group. The AL are connected, and the inside of the A seems to have a white tree in the middle, demonstrating figure/ground. The final T is part of the similarity group.\"}\n\nYou can read about the gestalt rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping) [@wikipediacontributors23d], but they are also demonstrated in the figure above.\n\nIn graphics, we can leverage the gestalt principles of grouping to create order and meaning.\nIf we color points by another variable, we are creating groups of similar points which assist with the perception of groups instead of individual observations.\nIf we add a trend line, we create the perception that the points are moving \"with\" the line (in most cases), or occasionally, that the line is dividing up two groups of points.\nDepending on what features of the data you wish to emphasize, you might choose different aesthetics mappings, facet variables, and factor orders.\n\n::: callout\nSuppose I want to emphasize the change in the murder rate between 1980 and 2010.\n\nI could use a bar chart (showing only the first 4 states alphabetically for space), a line chart (showing one line per state), or a box plot (showing variability over time).\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"3\" layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfbiwide <- read.csv(\"https://github.com/srvanderplas/Stat151/raw/main/data/fbiwide.csv\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nfbiwide %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(1980, 2010)) %>%\n  filter(State %in% c(\"Alabama\", \"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = Murder/Population*100000, fill = factor(Year))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n\nfbiwide %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(1980, 2010)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Murder/Population*100000, group = State)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n\nfbiwide %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(1980, 2010)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Murder/Population*100000)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart, showing 4 states](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-r-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Line chart, with one state per line](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-r-2.png){width=576}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Box plot by year](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-r-3.png){width=576}\n:::\n\nThree versions of the same data that emphasize different aspects of the dataset.\n:::\n\n\n#### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"3\" layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom plotnine import *\n\nfbiwide = r.fbiwide\nfbiwide = fbiwide.assign(YearFactor = pd.Categorical(fbiwide.Year))\nfbiwide = fbiwide.assign(Murder100k = fbiwide.Murder/fbiwide.Population * 100000)\n\nyr1980_2010 = fbiwide[fbiwide.Year.isin([1980,2010])]\nyr1980_2010 = yr1980_2010.assign(YearFactor = pd.Categorical(yr1980_2010.Year))\nsubdata = yr1980_2010[yr1980_2010.State.isin([\"Alabama\", \"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\"])]\n\n(\nggplot(subdata, aes(x = \"State\", y = \"Murder100k\", fill = \"YearFactor\")) +\n  geom_col(stat='identity', position = \"dodge\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<ggplot: (8753078442274)>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart, showing 4 states](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-py-1.png){width=614}\n:::\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(\nggplot(yr1980_2010, aes(x = \"Year\", y = \"Murder100k\", group = \"State\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<ggplot: (8753073331429)>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Line chart, with one state per line](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-py-2.png){width=614}\n:::\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(\nggplot(yr1980_2010, aes(x = \"YearFactor\", y = \"Murder100k\")) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ylab(\"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<ggplot: (8753073275218)>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Box plot by year](2023-REU_files/figure-html/chart-emphasis-py-3.png){width=614}\n:::\n\nThree versions of the same data that emphasize different aspects of the dataset.\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWhich one best demonstrates that in every state and region, the murder rate decreased?\n\n## Perceptual and Visual Limitations\n\nOur perceptual system is not infallible, and some people have additional challenges to work with.\n\n### Color\n\nAbout 10% of the XY population and 0.2% of the XX population has some form of colorblindness or color deficiency.\n\nHere are some basic tips for choosing color schemes for your charts.\n\n-   Do not use rainbow color gradient schemes\n\n    -   because of the unequal perception of different wavelengths, these schemes are *misleading* - the color distance does not match the perceptual distance.\n\n-   Avoid any scheme that uses green-yellow-red signaling if you have a target audience that may include colorblind people.\n\n-   To \"colorblind-proof\" a graphic, you can use a couple of strategies:\n\n    -   double encoding - where you use color, use another aesthetic (line type, shape) as well to help your colorblind readers out\n    -   If you can print your chart out in black and white and still read it, it will be safe for colorblind users. This is the only foolproof way to do it!\n    -   If you are using a color gradient, use a monochromatic color scheme where possible. This is perceived as light -\\> dark by colorblind people, so it will be correctly perceived no matter what color you use.\n    -   If you have a bidirectional scale (e.g. showing positive and negative values), the safest scheme to use is purple - white - orange. In any color scale that is multi-hue, it is important to transition through white, instead of from one color to another directly.\n\n-   Be conscious of what certain colors \"mean\"\n\n    -   Leveraging common associations can make it easier to read a color scale and remember what it stands for (e.g. blue for cold, orange/red for hot is a natural scale, red = Republican and blue = Democrat in the US, white -\\> blue gradients for showing rainfall totals)\n    -   Some colors can can provoke emotional responses that may not be desirable.[^1]\n    -   It is also important to be conscious of the social baggage that certain color schemes may have - the pink/blue color scheme often used to denote gender can be unnecessarily polarizing, and it may be easier to use a colder color (blue or purple) for men and a warmer color (yellow, orange, lighter green) for women[^2].\n\n[^1]: When the COVID-19 outbreak started, many maps were using white-to-red gradients to show case counts and/or deaths.\n    [The emotional association between red and blood, danger, and death may have caused people to become more frightened than what was reasonable given the available information.](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/mapping-coronavirus-responsibly/)\n\n[^2]: Lisa Charlotte Rost.\n    [What to consider when choosing colors for data visualization.](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/what-to-consider-when-choosing-colors-for-data-visualization/)\n\n### Working Memory\n\nWe can hold about 7 items in \"working memory\" and maintain these by rehearsing the content.\nAs a result, using a legend with more than 7 items will create additional cognitive load on those viewing the visualizations.\nWherever possible, keep cognitive limitations in mind\n\n### Alt Text and Accessibility\n\nSome individuals may have limited vision or visual processing ability.\nTo make your charts accessible, you should always provide [alt-text](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81) for your graphics.\n\nIt can also help to use larger text size and/or fonts that are easier to read for individuals with e.g. [dyslexia](https://opendyslexic.org/) [@zorzi_etal12].\nYou can customize your charts to make these changes, though instructions will vary based on which plotting system you are using.\n\n# Chart Types\n\n-   Graph Galleries\n    -   [Python](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/)\n    -   [R](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)\n    -   [D3.JS](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/)\n    -   [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/plot-gallery.html)\n    -   [SAS](https://support.sas.com/en/knowledge-base/graph-samples-gallery.html)\n    -   [Stata](https://surveydesign.com.au/stata/graphs.html)\n    -   [Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/available-chart-types-in-office-a6187218-807e-4103-9e0a-27cdb19afb90) :grimacing:\n\nChoose your chart type based on your data types as well as what you want to show:\n\n- If you have continuous data to show in X and Y, a scatterplot is a great idea. \n- If you have categorical data in X and continuous data in Y, you may want to consider a boxplot, violin plot, or jittered scatterplot. \n- If you have too much data in X and Y for a scatterplot, or you have a lot of categories in X or Y and continuous data in the other axis, you might try binning the continuous variable to create a heatmap.\n\n\n# Learn More\n\n- Statistical Computing in R and Python chapters:\n    - [Data Visualization Basics](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02-basic-data-vis.html)\n    - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02a-eda.html)\n    - [Data Visualization](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02b-graphics.html)\n    - [Creating Good Charts](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/02c-good-graphics.html)\n\n\n\n# References\n",
