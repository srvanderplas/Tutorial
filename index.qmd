[Hands-on (Shoes-off) Probability](Forensics/random-match-prob.qmd) - An introduction to probability in forensics with shoe prints.

[2023 REU - Creating Good Charts](2023-REU.html) [(pdf)](2023-REU.pdf)

[2022 Extension REU - Statistics with Cartoons](2022-Extension-REU.html) and [slides](2022-Extension-REU-slides.html)
